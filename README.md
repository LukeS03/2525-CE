A game by Luke Shanks.

This game was created for the University of Sussex's HackSussex 2024 Hackathon, and it is inspired by games like Minecraft, Terraria and Minicraft (a 2D top-down game made by Notch for a Ludum Dare challenge). 

It utilises the Godot engine, and it is aimed at the **BCS "Most Sustainable Hack"** and **HackSussex "Hack Artistry"** tracks.
